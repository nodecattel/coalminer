# Performance Summary
performance_summary = f"""
Performance Summary:
--------------------
Miner's current average difficulty: {miner_data['avg_difficulty_per_event']:.4f}
- This places you in the {percentile:.2f}th percentile, meaning you're performing better than {100 - percentile:.2f}% of miners.

Comparison to Peers:
--------------------
- Your average difficulty is {percentage_difference_24h:.2f}% above the 24-hour global average ({miner_data['avg_difficulty_per_event']:.4f} vs {last_24_hours_avg:.4f}).
- Compared to the top 25% of miners, you're trailing behind with a difficulty gap of {(1 - miner_data['avg_difficulty_per_event'] / sorted_miners[int(0.25 * total_miners)]['avg_difficulty_per_event']) * 100:.1f}% ({miner_data['avg_difficulty_per_event']:.4f} vs {sorted_miners[int(0.25 * total_miners)]['avg_difficulty_per_event']:.4f}).

Optimization Suggestions:
-------------------------
- Your average timing per event is {miner_data['avg_timing_per_event']:.2f} seconds. To improve, consider optimizing your hardware to reduce this figure.
- Potential earnings increase by 5-10% with reduced timing and optimized reward strategies.

Historical Trends:
------------------
- Your current difficulty is consistent with your historical average of {miner_data['avg_difficulty_per_event']:.2f}.
- In the past week, your best performance was a max difficulty of {miner_data['max_difficulty']}, matching your current peak.

Profitability Insights:
------------------------
- Youâ€™ve earned a total of {miner_data['total_rewards']:.4f} ORE from {miner_data['total_mining_events']} events.
- Consider boosting your setup to align with the top percentile for higher rewards.
